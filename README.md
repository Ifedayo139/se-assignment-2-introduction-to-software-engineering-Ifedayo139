# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

   software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the designing,developing,testing and maintaining of software applications. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
     software engineering compared to traditonal programming is driven by individual creativity and innovation.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
      this is the cost effective,time efficient process that is use to design and build high quality software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
planing:gathering business requirements from clients or stakeholders, invoves deciding what to make and what not to make.

Design: plans are elaborated into software design document and this is also where you flowchart how software responds to users interaction.

Development: the actual development stage where project is divided into modules and requirements into code that makes product.

Testing: quality assurerance testing to ensure software product is functioning properly.

Launch or Deployment: your final product is hereby delivered to intended user.

Maintenance:any bug,update or error are fixed or tested for better use. 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is a software development methodology that involves iterative development that evolve through collaboration between teams.
WAterfall is a software development methodology that involves rigid phases therefore when one ends another begins.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key 
differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The main difference between agile and waterfall is the time frame as waterfall is designed for long term projects with predetermined timelines while agile is uses short term iteration to deliver value rapidly,thereby allowing adjustment.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
This is a process of defining,documenting,and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process.
it invovles a process of identifying,elicting,analyzing,specifying,validating and managing the needs and expectation of a software system.
it is important as it helps reduce misunderstandings and errors.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity:logical partitioning to allow complex software to be manageable for the purpose of implementation and maintenance.
It improves creation of well defined component,clusters and modules enhancing maintainability also allowing easier scalability as systems evolve and grow.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing: test individual unit or component of the software.
integration testing:checking individual components to expose defects and problems to verify that they work together as designed.
system testing: here quality assurance teams evaluate how application interact together in full,integrated system or application.
acceptance testing:Or end user testing; it is the final testing stage to test if the software product delivers what it promises.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version control systems:the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
Examples
centrlized version control and features involve storing changes in central locations,giving quick access to recent files.
distributed version control [git,subversion] and features involve reliable back uo copies, fast merging and branching,rapid feedback,flexibility.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
software project manager is the liason between development team and stake holder therefore they maintain communication project status,managing changes,and requesting additional resources to help complete the project.
key responsibilities: discussing new projects,planning nsoftware project,assembling project teams and allocating roles,managing project progress to ensure project stays on schedule.
challenges:communication challenges, lack of accountability, resource allocation , poor planning and urealistic deadlines.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
 software maintenance is the modification of software products after delivery.
 Types:
 corrective;adresses errors and faults within software applications ussually from bug reports.
 adaptive;invoves when environment of software changes due to change in Operating system,hardware or software tendencies.
 perfective;focuses on evolution of requirements and features existing in your system.
 preventive;make changes to allow long term use.
  maintenance is an essential part of software life cycle because it helps to keep it up and running, enhance features,rework system for changes or other changes.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ethical issues:changing requirements, tight deadlines, techinical depbt, strategies for oveercoming challenges.
They can adhere to ethical standards in their work by being honest and trust worthy, being truthful about qualifications,capabilities and potential impact of their work.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
